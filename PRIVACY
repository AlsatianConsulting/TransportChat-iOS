  Privacy Policy – TransportChat

  Last Updated: 12/26/2025

  TransportChat (“we,” “our,” “us”) is a local, peer‑to‑peer messaging app. We do not operate a cloud service and we do
  not sell your data.

  1. What We Collect

  - No Accounts: TransportChat does not require login or account creation.
  - No Cloud Storage: Messages and transfers stay on your devices; we do not receive or store them.
  - Device Permissions: We request access to your camera, photos, and files only so you can capture and send media or
  save received items. These permissions are used locally.

  2. How Data Is Used

  - Messaging & File Transfer: Content is encrypted end‑to‑end over your local network. We do not access or analyze your
  messages or files.
  - Local Caching: Temporary files (e.g., drafts, received media before saving) may be stored on your device and are
  managed by you.
  - Diagnostics: We do not collect analytics or crash reports unless you choose to share them through your device’s
  OS‑level settings.

  3. Sharing of Data

  - We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to third parties. Transfers occur directly between devices you connect
  to on your local network.

  4. Security

  - Messages and file transfers use modern encryption (ECDH + AES‑GCM). Security also depends on your device’s
  protection (passcode/biometrics) and network security.

  5. Your Choices

  - Permissions: You can change camera, photo library, and file access in your device settings.
  - Data Control: Delete chats, files, and cached data from within the app or via your device storage settings.

  6. Children’s Privacy

  - TransportChat is not directed to children under 13. If you believe a child is using the app and providing personal
  information, contact us to request deletion.

  7. Changes to This Policy

  - We may update this policy. Material changes will be reflected with a new “Last Updated” date.
